        "Self-Modeling Based Diagnosis of Software-Defined Networks": "The related work highlights existing approaches to model-based diagnosis primarily focused on static topologies, discussing their shortcomings in handling dynamically changing environments, especially in the context of SDN and NFV. The paper advances the state of the art by proposing a self-modeling diagnosis that dynamically constructs dependency graphs while considering finer granularities of network components."
